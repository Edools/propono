Propono is a [pub/sub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish-subscribe_pattern) gem built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Queue Service (SQS) to seamlessly pass messages throughout your infrastructure.

Usage is as simple as adding your config keys then running commands such as:

```ruby
Propono.listen_to_queue('some-topic') do |message|
  ...
end
Propono.publish('some-topic', "This message will get from A to B")
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'propono'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

The first thing to do is setup some configuration keys for Propono.

```ruby
Propono.config.access_key       = "access-key"       # From AWS
Propono.config.secret_key       = "secret-key"       # From AWS
Propono.config.queue_region     = "queue-region"     # From AWS
```

You can then start publishing messages easily from anywhere in your codebase.

```ruby
Propono.publish('some-topic', "{some: ['payload', 'or', 'message']}")
```

Listening for messages is easy too. When you ask Propono to listen, it automatically sets up a SQS queue and links it into SNS.

```ruby
Propono.config.application_name = "application-name" # Something unique to this app.
Propono.listen_to_queue('some-topic') do |sqs_message|
  original_message = JSON.parse(sqs_message["Body"])["Message"]
  # ... Do something interesting with the message
end
```

###Â Using UDP for messages

If you want almost-zero performance impact, and don't care about whether the message gets lost, you can use UDP. We use this for things like our live dashboard.

To send messages, you need to set up a little extra config:

```ruby
Propono.config.udp_host = "localhost"
Propono.config.udp_port = 12543
```
You then simply pass the `:udp` protocol into `publish`

```ruby
Propono.publish('some-topic', message, protocol: :udp)
```

Setting up another service running Propono to listen to the UDP feed is easy. For example, with the same config:

```ruby
Propono.listen_to_udp do |topic, message|
  Propono.publish(topic, message) # Proxy the message to SNS
end
```

This proxy pattern is used so often that there's a simple shortcut:

```ruby
Propono.proxy_udp()
```
